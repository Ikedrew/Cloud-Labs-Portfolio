# Cloud-Labs-Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on labs Iâ€™ve completed while learning and practicing cloud technologies, primarily on Microsoft Azure. Each lab documents the objective, step-by-step process, challenges, and outcomes, and is exported as a PDF for easy reference.

The purpose of this portfolio is to:

- Demonstrate my practical experience with Azure and cloud administration.

- Showcase problem-solving and troubleshooting skills through real-world scenarios.

- Track my progress as I build toward cloud engineering and IT support roles.

Labs currently include topics such as subnetting, VM disk management, NSG configuration, and connectivity testing, with more to come.
